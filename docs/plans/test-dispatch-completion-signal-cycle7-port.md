# Port test_dispatch_completion_signal to Cycle-7 Pattern Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Un-xfail and green `tests/test_dispatch_completion_signal.py` at opus-4-7 teams mode by rewriting it on top of the cycle-7 streaming watcher + inbox-poll keep-alive pattern. Haiku-teams stays xfailed with a rationale matching the cycle-7 haiku xfail pattern.

**Architecture:** Replace `run_first_officer` + `LogParser` with `run_first_officer_streaming` + `FOStreamWatcher`. Pin to `@pytest.mark.teams_mode`. Assert the completion-signal contract via one `expect(_is_team_create)` + one `expect_dispatch_close(ensign_name="work")` + a post-hoc entity-archival check on disk. The `work` stage is worktree-enabled and has no downstream dispatches; the contract is literally "FO saw the ensign's Done and advanced the entity to done", which is exactly what the cycle-7 pattern surfaces.

**Tech Stack:** Python, pytest, `scripts/test_lib.py` (`run_first_officer_streaming`, `FOStreamWatcher`, `DispatchBudget`, `expect_dispatch_close`), `scripts/fo_inbox_poll.py`, `tests/fixtures/completion-signal-pipeline/`.

---

## Background

`tests/test_dispatch_completion_signal.py` verifies the core contract that #114 originally tracked: a team-dispatched ensign's `SendMessage(to="team-lead", "Done: ...")` must wake the FO, which then advances the entity past the dispatched stage. Pre-fix the FO's `DISPATCH IDLE GUARDRAIL` would wait forever because it never observed the completion signal.

Currently xfailed under entity #198 as "pending #198 — runtime FO team-mode completion-signal exit hang". Evidence from cycle-6 full-suite runs (`docs/plans/_evidence/green-opus-4-7-full-suite/cycle6/`): the failure is `fo_exit != 0 within budget`. Cycle-7 identified the upstream root cause ([anthropics/claude-code#26426](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/26426)): `InboxPoller` is a React UI hook and doesn't fire under `claude -p`. The completion signal physically lands in `$HOME/.claude/teams/{team}/inboxes/team-lead.json` but is never delivered to the FO's stream. The cycle-7 workaround (external polling script surfaces inbox entries as Bash tool_result) is the exact fix this test needs.

This is the **cleanest cycle-7 port target** of the three Tier-A siblings: single dispatchable stage, no gates, no feedback-to, no reuse contract. The only contract is "FO observed Done, advanced status."

## Fixture shape (unchanged)

`tests/fixtures/completion-signal-pipeline/README.md`:

```yaml
stages:
  defaults:
    worktree: false
    fresh: false
    gate: false
    concurrency: 2
  states:
    - name: backlog
      initial: true
    - name: work
      worktree: true
    - name: done
      terminal: true
```

Single dispatchable stage (`work`), no gates, no feedback-to. No fixture edits required.

## Expected FO trajectory (teams mode, opus-4-7)

1. `TeamCreate(test-project-completion-signal-pipeline-...)`
2. `Agent(subagent_type="spacedock:ensign", description="... work")` — initial and only dispatch
3. (ensign runs in its worktree → creates the deliverable → commits → emits `SendMessage(to="team-lead", "Done: ...completed work...")`)
4. FO polls inbox via Bash → reads the `Done:` message
5. FO advances status: `work → done` via `status --set`, commits on main, optionally archives
6. Test harness touches keep-alive sentinel → FO exits

## Contract assertions

Post-rewrite `Phase 3`:

1. `TeamCreate` emitted.
2. `expect_dispatch_close(ensign_name="work", overall_timeout_s=120, dispatch_budget_s=90)` — ensign closes.
3. Sentinel touched; `expect_exit` wrapped in try/except.
4. Post-hoc on disk: entity file `completion-signal-task.md` is either archived OR has `status: done` in frontmatter.
5. Post-hoc sanity: the ensign's dispatch prompt (recoverable from the Agent tool_use input in the FO log via an inline helper) contains `SendMessage(to="team-lead"` — verifies the FO's dispatch template still injects the completion-signal instruction.

Note: the original test has a fallback for bare mode ("FO dispatched in bare mode (no team_name); SendMessage unnecessary"). The rewrite pins to `teams_mode`, so the bare-fallback branch is removed. Bare mode is not exercised here.

## File Structure

- Create: (none)
- Modify: `tests/test_dispatch_completion_signal.py` (complete rewrite — 124 lines → ~170 lines on the cycle-7 template)
- Test: `tests/test_dispatch_completion_signal.py` itself

No new scripts. `scripts/fo_inbox_poll.py` from cycle-7 is reused verbatim.

## Task breakdown

### Task 1: Rewrite test_dispatch_completion_signal.py on the cycle-7 template

**Files:**
- Modify: `tests/test_dispatch_completion_signal.py` (complete rewrite)

- [ ] **Step 1: Read the cycle-7 reference implementation**

Open `tests/test_feedback_keepalive.py` and note: imports, module constants (`PER_STAGE_OVERALL_S = 120`, `PER_DISPATCH_BUDGET_S = 90`, `SUBPROCESS_EXIT_BUDGET_S = 180`), `_is_tool_use` / `_is_team_create` / `_is_send_message_to` helpers, haiku xfail block (commit `d2491301`), `headless_hint` with inbox-poll directive at timeout=5, context-managed `run_first_officer_streaming` with `DispatchBudget(soft_s=30.0, hard_s=180.0, shutdown_grace_s=10.0)`, the `expect` → `expect_dispatch_close` → sentinel touch → try/except `expect_exit` flow.

- [ ] **Step 2: Replace the full file body**

Overwrite `tests/test_dispatch_completion_signal.py` with:

```python
# ABOUTME: E2E regression test for team-mode dispatch completion-signal in the FO template.
# ABOUTME: Pinned to teams_mode; asserts TeamCreate + work dispatch close + entity advances to done.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run static tests**

Run: `cd /Users/clkao/git/spacedock/.worktrees/spacedock-ensign-opus-4-7-green-main && make test-static`
Expected: 475 passed (unchanged; no content test inspects this file).

- [ ] **Step 4: Run offline dispatch-budget unit tests**

Run: `uv run pytest tests/test_dispatch_budget.py -x -q`
Expected: 21 passed (same cycle-7 watcher anchors).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/test_dispatch_completion_signal.py
git commit -m "impl: #211 rewrite test_dispatch_completion_signal on cycle-7 pattern

Replace run_first_officer + LogParser with run_first_officer_streaming +
FOStreamWatcher. Pin @pytest.mark.teams_mode, un-xfail on opus-4-7,
retain haiku xfail (anthropics/claude-code#26426 class).

Contract: TeamCreate -> work dispatch close -> entity advances to done.
Drop the bare-mode fallback branch (test is teams-only now). Retain the
dispatch-template sanity check (FO's Agent prompt must carry
SendMessage(to=\"team-lead\"...) instruction) via a small inline helper.

make test-static: 475 passed. offline dispatch-budget: 21 passed."
```

### Task 2: Live verification at opus-4-7 teams mode

**Files:**
- (none — test-only)

- [ ] **Step 1: Prepare isolated temp dir**

Run: `mkdir -p /tmp/completion-r1`

- [ ] **Step 2: Single live run**

Run:

```bash
cd /Users/clkao/git/spacedock/.worktrees/spacedock-ensign-opus-4-7-green-main && \
  unset CLAUDECODE && \
  KEEP_TEST_DIR=1 SPACEDOCK_TEST_TMP_ROOT=/tmp/completion-r1 \
  CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1 \
  uv run pytest tests/test_dispatch_completion_signal.py --runtime claude \
    --model opus --effort low --team-mode=teams -v
```

Expected: PASSED in 2-4 minutes. Single-stage pipeline is faster than keepalive.

- [ ] **Step 3: Triage on failure**

If red, inspect the fo-log:
- `find /tmp/completion-r1 -name "fo-log.jsonl" | head -1`
- Look for `fo_inbox_poll.py` Bash invocations and check that at least one tool_result contains `from: spacedock-ensign-completion-signal-task-work` + `text: Done: ...completed work...`.
- Confirm the entity's frontmatter was transitioned to `status: done` or archived.
- If dispatch never closed: check whether the FO sent `shutdown_request` (keep-alive rule violation) — file a follow-up entity if the discipline slipped.

---

### Task 3: Un-xfail entity #198 + stage report

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/plans/fo-runtime-test-failures-post-154.md` (update the `test_dispatch_completion_signal` section)
- Modify: `docs/plans/test-dispatch-completion-signal-cycle7-port.md` (set `status: done`, add stage report)

- [ ] **Step 1: Update #198's section on this test**

In `docs/plans/fo-runtime-test-failures-post-154.md`, under the `test_dispatch_completion_signal` heading (near line 28), add a note:

```markdown
**Resolved by cycle-7 port (#211).** The root cause was anthropics/claude-code#26426 (InboxPoller is a React UI hook, doesn't fire under `-p`). The cycle-7 keep-alive + inbox-poll pattern ports cleanly here; the test was rewritten on that shape and green at opus-4-7 teams N=1 in {wallclock}. See `docs/plans/test-dispatch-completion-signal-cycle7-port.md`.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Update this entity's status**

Set frontmatter to:

```yaml
status: done
completed: "{ISO-8601 timestamp}"
verdict: PASSED
```

Add a brief `## Stage Report: implementation` section with commit SHAs for the rewrite + live run wallclock + fo-log evidence path.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit and push**

```bash
git add docs/plans/fo-runtime-test-failures-post-154.md docs/plans/test-dispatch-completion-signal-cycle7-port.md
git commit -m "report: #211 done — test_dispatch_completion_signal green at opus-4-7 teams

{wallclock} single-run; #198 section updated with cycle-7 resolution note."
git push origin spacedock-ensign/opus-4-7-green-main
```

---

## Acceptance criteria

1. `tests/test_dispatch_completion_signal.py` no longer uses `run_first_officer` / `LogParser`; uses `run_first_officer_streaming` + `DispatchBudget` + `FOStreamWatcher.expect_dispatch_close`.
2. Test carries `@pytest.mark.teams_mode`; `@pytest.mark.xfail(...reason="pending #198"...)` is gone; inline `pytest.xfail` guard exists only for `model == "claude-haiku-4-5"`.
3. Prompt is a single line: `f"Process all tasks through the workflow at {abs_workflow}/ to terminal completion."` — no coaching.
4. Bare-mode fallback branch removed; test is teams-mode-only.
5. `make test-static` passes at 475+ tests.
6. `uv run pytest tests/test_dispatch_budget.py` stays at 21 passed.
7. Single live run at `--model opus --effort low --team-mode=teams` with `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` passes cleanly in 2-4 minutes.
8. `docs/plans/fo-runtime-test-failures-post-154.md` carries a resolution note pointing at this entity.
9. This entity's status advances to `done` with a stage report.

## Coordination notes

- Concurrent cycle-8 work on `test_standing_teammate` and `test_merge_hook_guardrail` does not touch this file or its fixture.
- Sibling entities: #210 (`test-rejection-flow-cycle7-port`), #211 (`test-checklist-e2e-runtime-text-assertion-fix`) — different bug classes; independent.
- No shared-core prose edits required.

## Out of scope

- Bare-mode sibling. Bare `Agent()` is synchronous; "completion signal" in bare is the tool_result payload itself, not an inbox message. Different contract; needs its own test if required.
- Fixing the FO prose to emit the completion-signal instruction under alternate template paths. The current template does the right thing; we just test it.

## Summary

Smallest of the three Tier-A cycle-7 ports. One-stage fixture, one dispatch assertion, one post-hoc on-disk check, one dispatch-template sanity check. Expected outcome: opus-4-7 teams GREEN, haiku xfailed with rationale matching cycle-7.
