title: "Pin --model claude-opus-4-6 in CI workflow defaults (until upstream opus-4-7 regression resolves)"
status: done
source: "from #177 + #178 cluster — opus-4-7 regression at low/medium effort makes claude-live-opus CI job unreliable. #178's boilerplate mitigation falsified by #177. This is the temporary unblocker for #172 PR #107 and any other PR whose CI runs hit opus-4-7 default. Reversible — pinning is a workflow-default change, not a code change; explicit model_override still works."

## Why this matters

172's PR #107 has 4/5 jobs green; the 5th (claude-live-opus) fails on opus-4-7 (the regression #177 is investigating). #177's #178-boilerplate mitigation was falsified at low/medium effort. The cleanest unblocker for 172 — and any other PR sitting in the same cluster — is to pin `claude-live-opus`'s effective model to `claude-opus-4-6` until upstream resolves the opus-4-7 hallucination.

This is reversible: it's a workflow-default change, not a code or test change. Explicit `model_override` workflow input still works for anyone who wants to test opus-4-7 directly.

## The change

Edit `.github/workflows/runtime-live-e2e.yml`:
- Locate the `claude-live-opus` job's model resolution (the input default or the env var that resolves to `--model opus`).
- Change the default from `opus` (which now resolves to `claude-opus-4-7` under Claude Code 2.1.111+) to `claude-opus-4-6` explicitly.
- Preserve `model_override` workflow input handling so future testers can override back to `opus` or any other value.

The `model_override` plumbing into `claude -p` already works end-to-end (verified by #179's fix; confirmed by #180's audit).

## Acceptance criteria

1. **Workflow YAML edit is surgical.** Only the `claude-live-opus` job's default model resolution changes. Other jobs (`claude-live`, `claude-live-bare`, `codex-live`, `static-offline`) untouched.
2. **Static suite passes.** `make test-static` from the worktree root, ≥ 422 passed (current main baseline).
3. **The pin is documented in the workflow file.** Inline comment explains why pinning, links to #177 + this entity.
4. **Verification: dispatch one CI run on the worktree branch with no model_override input.** The `claude-live-opus` job should now run on `claude-opus-4-6` (verify via `gh run download` + grep `assistant.message.model` from the run's `fo-log.jsonl`).

## Test plan

- Static: `make test-static` from worktree root.
- Live: one CI dispatch on the worktree branch via `gh workflow run runtime-live-e2e.yml --ref spacedock-ensign/pin-opus-4-6-ci-default -f claude_version=2.1.111` (no model_override). Capture run URL, claude-live-opus job conclusion, and model stamps from fo-log.jsonl.
- Total cost: ~5 min CI minutes (one focused dispatch).

## Out of Scope

- Any change to the `--model` default in test files (test_standing_teammate_spawn.py and friends) — those already correctly read pytest's `--model` option per #179.
- Pinning `claude-live` or any non-opus job (only opus is broken).
- Reverting the pin once upstream fixes opus-4-7 — that's a future task triggered by upstream signal.
- Long-term decision on whether opus-4-6 should be the *permanent* default — this is a temporary pin pending upstream.

## Cross-references

- #177 — root cause investigation (now repurposed to Layer 2 mitigation experiments)
- #178 — falsified low/medium-effort boilerplate mitigation (likely won't ship in current form)
- #172 — direct beneficiary; PR #107 will reach 5/5 green CI once this lands and 172 rebases
- #179 — landed the model_override plumbing that makes this pin work end-to-end
- #180 — closed REJECTED-duplicate (audit confirming #179 covers all live tests)

## Stage Report (implementation)

### Checklist

1. **Read entity body in full** — DONE. Spec is complete: `## The change`, `## Acceptance criteria`, `## Test plan` all present and unambiguous.
2. **Inspect workflow file, locate claude-live-opus model resolution** — DONE. `claude-live-opus` job spans lines 367-534 of `.github/workflows/runtime-live-e2e.yml`. Two literal `"opus"` defaults found inside the job: (a) line 488 in the "Show tool versions" step (`EFFECTIVE_MODEL="opus"` for the step summary), (b) line 518 in the "Run Claude live suite (opus)" step (`MODEL_FLAG="opus"`, the value actually passed as `--model "$MODEL_FLAG"` on line 523). Resolution chain: `workflow_dispatch.inputs.model_override` → job step `env: MODEL_OVERRIDE: ${{ inputs.model_override }}` → shell `if [ -n "$MODEL_OVERRIDE" ]; then ...; else MODEL_FLAG="opus"; fi`. No other `opus` defaults in the job; no env-var-level default.
3. **Identify smallest change** — DONE. Shape (a) from the spec applied: change the in-shell default values from `"opus"` to `"claude-opus-4-6"`. Both the display string (line 488) and the actual `--model` flag (line 518) updated for consistency. Workflow structure, other jobs, and `model_override` plumbing untouched. Total diff: 4 insertions, 2 deletions, 1 file.
4. **Apply change with inline comment** — DONE. Two comment lines added (one above each changed default), both reading: `# Pinned to claude-opus-4-6 due to opus-4-7 ensign hallucination regression at low/medium effort; see #177 / #181. Reversible — restore default to opus once upstream resolves.`

   Before/after at line 488 (display default in "Show tool versions" step):
   ```
   - EFFECTIVE_MODEL="opus"
   + # Pinned to claude-opus-4-6 due to opus-4-7 ensign hallucination regression at low/medium effort; see #177 / #181. Reversible — restore default to opus once upstream resolves.
   + EFFECTIVE_MODEL="claude-opus-4-6"
   ```

   Before/after at line 518 (actual `--model` flag in "Run Claude live suite (opus)" step):
   ```
   - MODEL_FLAG="opus"
   + # Pinned to claude-opus-4-6 due to opus-4-7 ensign hallucination regression at low/medium effort; see #177 / #181. Reversible — restore default to opus once upstream resolves.
   + MODEL_FLAG="claude-opus-4-6"
   ```

5. **Static suite** — DONE. Ran `unset CLAUDECODE && make test-static` from worktree root.

   Final line verbatim:
   ```
   426 passed, 22 deselected, 10 subtests passed in 20.35s
   ```
   Zero failures. Above the AC #2 baseline of ≥ 422 passed (matches/exceeds main).
6. **Commit on worktree branch** — DONE. Commit `ca21f49f` on `spacedock-ensign/pin-opus-4-6-ci-default` with message `fix: #181 pin claude-live-opus to claude-opus-4-6 default (opus-4-7 regression workaround)`. Not pushed (FO handles push at merge boundary).
7. **Stage report written** — DONE (this section).
8. **Validator AC-4 dispatch note** — DONE. Validator should dispatch one CI run on `spacedock-ensign/pin-opus-4-6-ci-default` (no `model_override` input) and confirm `claude-live-opus` runs on `claude-opus-4-6` via `gh run download` + grep `assistant.message.model` from `fo-log.jsonl`. **IMPORTANT FLAG FOR VALIDATOR:** the YAML's `--model "$MODEL_FLAG"` path is only exercised when `test_selector` is non-empty (lines 508-523). When `test_selector` is empty (the typical PR-trigger and unselected dispatch path), the workflow falls through to `make test-live-claude-opus` at line 525, and that Makefile target (Makefile lines 32-40) **still hardcodes `--model opus`** — out of scope per AC #1 ("only the workflow YAML edit"). To exercise the new pin via AC-4, the validator's dispatch should set `test_selector` to a representative live-claude opus test (e.g. an `@pytest.mark.live_claude` test path) so the YAML's MODEL_FLAG branch executes. If the validator wants the pin active on the default (no-selector) make path as well, that needs a follow-up entity touching the Makefile target.

### Files changed

- `.github/workflows/runtime-live-e2e.yml` (4 insertions, 2 deletions; both edits inside `claude-live-opus` job)

### Summary

Pinned the `claude-live-opus` job's default model from `opus` (which now resolves to `claude-opus-4-7` under Claude Code 2.1.111+) to explicit `claude-opus-4-6` by changing two literal defaults in the job's shell steps; `model_override` workflow input is preserved and remains the only escape hatch. Inline comments link to #177 / #181 with a reversibility note. Static suite at 426 passed (≥ 422 baseline). Validator should exercise AC-4 via a dispatch with `test_selector` set, since the no-selector path delegates to `make test-live-claude-opus` whose own hardcoded `--model opus` is intentionally out of scope per AC #1.

   Confirmed:
   - (a) Only `.github/workflows/runtime-live-e2e.yml` is touched in our two commits (`ca21f49f` workflow change + `bd3762dd` entity body). `git log main..HEAD --stat` shows the workflow commit modifies only this file (4 insertions, 2 deletions).
   - (b) Both changed lines are inside the `claude-live-opus` job's MODEL_OVERRIDE-fallback `else` branches (lines 488 and 518 in the original).
   - (c) The `if [ -n "$MODEL_OVERRIDE" ]; then ...; else ...; fi` structure is preserved verbatim — `model_override` workflow input still takes precedence.
   - (d) Each inline comment cites `#177 / #181` and includes the reversibility note (`Reversible — restore default to opus once upstream resolves`).

3. **Re-run static suite** — DONE. Ran `unset CLAUDECODE && make test-static` from the worktree root.

   Final line verbatim:
   ```
   426 passed, 22 deselected, 10 subtests passed in 20.02s
   ```
   Zero failures. Matches the implementer's run (426/426). AC #2 (≥ 422) satisfied.

4. **Verify no other files/jobs touched** — DONE. `git diff --name-only main..HEAD` shows three paths:
   - `.github/workflows/runtime-live-e2e.yml` — our workflow change.
   - `docs/plans/pin-opus-4-6-ci-default.md` — the entity body (allowed).
   - `docs/plans/opus-4-7-ensign-hallucination-scope.md` — NOT from our commits; provenance is commit `59a0db41` (`advance: #177 entering implementation …`), present in the worktree base but absent from local `main` ref. Verified by `git log main..HEAD -- docs/plans/opus-4-7-ensign-hallucination-scope.md` returning empty for our two-commit range. Out of scope; not introduced by #181.

   Within `.github/workflows/runtime-live-e2e.yml`, only the `claude-live-opus` job is touched. Other jobs (`claude-live`, `claude-live-bare`, `codex-live`, `static-offline`) untouched.

5. **AC-1, AC-2, AC-3 confirmation** — DONE.
   - **AC-1 (workflow YAML edit is surgical):** PASS — see step 2 evidence; only the `claude-live-opus` job's two fallback defaults change.
   - **AC-2 (static suite passes, ≥ 422):** PASS — 426 passed (see step 3).
   - **AC-3 (inline comment present, links #177 + #181, reversibility note):** PASS — both inserted comments include `see #177 / #181` and `Reversible — restore default to opus once upstream resolves` (see step 2 diff).

6. **AC-4 (live CI dispatch verification)** — DEFERRED-TO-MERGE-HOOK. AC-4 requires pushing the branch and dispatching a live CI run, which needs captain approval per the pr-merge mod's PR APPROVAL GUARDRAIL. The push will happen at the merge hook after captain approves the validation gate; CI will dispatch as part of normal PR flow. Not exercised in this validation; not pushing the branch; not dispatching CI.

   Implementer's flag re-stated for the merge-hook step: the YAML's `--model "$MODEL_FLAG"` path is only exercised when `test_selector` is non-empty. The no-selector path delegates to `make test-live-claude-opus`, whose hardcoded `--model opus` is intentionally out of scope per AC #1. To exercise the new pin via AC-4 the dispatch should set `test_selector` to a representative live-claude opus test path.

7. **Stage report appended** — DONE (this section).

8. **Commit on worktree branch** — pending immediately after this write; not pushed.

Recommendation: PASSED — diff is surgical, static suite 426/426 green, AC-4 deferred to merge hook.

## Stage Report (implementation, scope expansion)

Captain-directed scope expansion: the original narrow-scope work (commits `ca21f49f` workflow + `bd3762dd` entity body) only pinned the YAML's `--model "$MODEL_FLAG"` selector path. The validator flagged that the no-selector PR-trigger path delegates to `make test-live-claude-opus`, which has its own hardcoded `--model opus` and bypasses the pin entirely. This expansion adds the make-target fix on top.

### Checklist

1. **Read entity body in full (incl. prior implementation + validation reports)** — DONE. Both prior reports reviewed end-to-end. Original narrow scope confirmed shipped on this branch; no-selector path gap confirmed flagged.

2. **Confirm captain-directed scope-expansion context** — DONE. Original work stays untouched; this dispatch ADDS the make-target fix on top. PR #116 stays open; new commits get added.

3. **Inspect Makefile `test-live-claude-opus` target + workflow no-selector invocation** — DONE.
   - `Makefile` lines 30-40 (pre-edit): `test-live-claude-opus` hardcoded `--model opus` in two pytest invocations (serial + parallel).
   - `.github/workflows/runtime-live-e2e.yml` line 527 (pre-edit): no-selector branch ran `make test-live-claude-opus` with no model arg, so the make target's hardcoded `opus` won — the YAML's MODEL_FLAG was computed but unused on this path.

4. **Identify smallest change** — DONE. Shape from spec applied:
   - Makefile: introduce `OPUS_MODEL ?= claude-opus-4-6` (defaults to opus-4-6 directly, NOT the broken `opus` alias) and substitute `--model opus` → `--model $(OPUS_MODEL)` in the two pytest invocations of `test-live-claude-opus`. Override capability preserved: `make test-live-claude-opus OPUS_MODEL=opus` re-tests on opus-4-7.
   - Workflow YAML: hoist the `MODEL_OVERRIDE`-fallback computation above the `if [ -n "$TEST_SELECTOR" ]` branch so MODEL_FLAG is available to both branches; pass `OPUS_MODEL="$MODEL_FLAG"` to `make test-live-claude-opus` on the no-selector branch. The selector branch's behavior is unchanged (still uses `--model "$MODEL_FLAG"`).

5. **Apply changes with inline comments** — DONE. Inline comments added in both files citing #177 / #181 + reversibility note + override syntax.

   Note: the YAML edit hoists the `MODEL_OVERRIDE`-fallback `if/else` above the `TEST_SELECTOR` branch so MODEL_FLAG is computed once and used by both paths.

   Confirms `--model foo`. Override capability preserved.

9. **Commit on worktree branch** — pending immediately after this write; not pushed (FO handles push at re-merge boundary).

10. **Validator re-verification note** — DONE. The validator now needs to re-verify BOTH paths:
    - **YAML-direct path** (`test_selector` non-empty): the previous validation's PASSED still holds for the structural pin; minor structural hoist of the `MODEL_OVERRIDE`-fallback `if/else` above the `TEST_SELECTOR` branch should be confirmed byte-equivalent in the selector branch's effective behavior.
    - **Make-target path** (no `test_selector`, the typical PR-trigger path): new in this expansion. Validator should confirm `make -n test-live-claude-opus` shows `--model claude-opus-4-6` and that the workflow's no-selector branch passes `OPUS_MODEL="$MODEL_FLAG"` to make. AC-4 live dispatch (if exercised) should now show opus-4-6 stamps in fo-log.jsonl on EITHER trigger path.

Pinned the `make test-live-claude-opus` target's default model to `claude-opus-4-6` via a new `OPUS_MODEL ?= claude-opus-4-6` Makefile variable (overridable as `make test-live-claude-opus OPUS_MODEL=opus`); hoisted the workflow's `MODEL_OVERRIDE`-fallback above the `TEST_SELECTOR` branch and propagated the resolved MODEL_FLAG to make as `OPUS_MODEL="$MODEL_FLAG"`, so the no-selector PR-trigger path (which delegates to `make test-live-claude-opus`) also picks up claude-opus-4-6 by default. Static suite at 426 passed; `make -n` confirms default expands to `--model claude-opus-4-6` and `OPUS_MODEL=foo` override expands to `--model foo`. Validator should re-verify both YAML-direct and make-target paths now.

## Stage Report (validation, scope expansion)

This is the second validation pass for #181. The first validation PASSED the original narrow scope (YAML claude-live-opus MODEL_OVERRIDE-fallback only). Captain re-scoped the work to also cover the no-selector make-target path; this validation re-verifies BOTH paths post-expansion.

### Checklist

1. **Read entity body in full (incl. prior implementation, validation, and scope-expansion reports)** — DONE. All four prior sections reviewed end-to-end. Original narrow-scope work (commits `8112e5a3` workflow + `fba7265d` entity body) confirmed shipped; first-validation PASSED at commit `3e3bd2b4`; scope-expansion shipped at commit `a7fdf48a` (Makefile + workflow YAML + entity body in a single commit).

2. **Verify diff is surgical and covers BOTH paths** — DONE.

   Provenance check: `docs/plans/opus-4-7-ensign-hallucination-scope.md` is from commit `59a0db41` (`advance: #177 entering implementation …`, present in the worktree base; unrelated to #181 — same observation as the first validation). Our scope-expansion commit `a7fdf48a` touches exactly three files: `Makefile`, `.github/workflows/runtime-live-e2e.yml`, and the entity body — confirmed via `git show --stat a7fdf48a`.

   ```

   Confirmed: the YAML hoists the `MODEL_OVERRIDE`-fallback above the `TEST_SELECTOR` branch (so MODEL_FLAG is computed once and used by both branches), the selector path's `--model "$MODEL_FLAG"` invocation is preserved byte-equivalent, and the no-selector path now propagates `OPUS_MODEL="$MODEL_FLAG"` to the make target. Display string in the "Show tool versions" step (line 488) remains pinned to `claude-opus-4-6`.

3. **Verify Makefile change introduces `OPUS_MODEL ?= claude-opus-4-6` (NOT the broken `opus` alias) and substitutes both pytest invocations** — DONE.
   - New variable line: `OPUS_MODEL ?= claude-opus-4-6` — defaults to the explicit version, not the `opus` alias.
   - Serial pytest invocation (`-m "live_claude and serial"`): `--model opus` → `--model $(OPUS_MODEL)`.
   - Parallel pytest invocation (`-m "live_claude and not serial"`): `--model opus` → `--model $(OPUS_MODEL)`.
   - Other Makefile targets (`test-static`, `test-live-claude`, `test-live-codex`, `test-live-claude-bare`, `test-e2e`, etc.) NOT touched — confirmed by the Makefile diff scope (only lines 6-8 and 32-40 modified).

4. **Verify make-target effective resolution via `make -n`** — DONE.

   Default (`make -n test-live-claude-opus 2>&1 | grep -- '--model'`):
   ```
   	    -m "live_claude and serial" --runtime claude --model claude-opus-4-6 --effort low -x -v ; SEQ=$? ; \
   	    -m "live_claude and not serial" --runtime claude --model claude-opus-4-6 --effort low \
   ```
   Both pytest invocations expand to `--model claude-opus-4-6`. PASS.

   Override (`make -n test-live-claude-opus OPUS_MODEL=opus 2>&1 | grep -- '--model'`):
   ```
   	    -m "live_claude and serial" --runtime claude --model opus --effort low -x -v ; SEQ=$? ; \
   	    -m "live_claude and not serial" --runtime claude --model opus --effort low \
   ```
   Both pytest invocations expand to `--model opus` when override is supplied. Override mechanism preserved. PASS.

5. **Verify workflow YAML covers no-selector path** — DONE. From the YAML diff in step 2:
   - The no-selector branch (`else` after `if [ -n "$TEST_SELECTOR" ]`) now invokes `make test-live-claude-opus OPUS_MODEL="$MODEL_FLAG"`. The pin propagates as `--model claude-opus-4-6` into the make target's pytest invocations.
   - The MODEL_FLAG computation is hoisted ABOVE the `if [ -n "$TEST_SELECTOR" ]` branch (was previously inside the selector branch only). It is no longer duplicated; one resolution serves both branches.
   - The selector branch's `--model "$MODEL_FLAG"` path is preserved verbatim (the inner `if [ -n "$MODEL_OVERRIDE" ]` block was removed since MODEL_FLAG is now hoisted above; the `pytest "$TEST_SELECTOR" --runtime claude --model "$MODEL_FLAG"` invocation is unchanged). Effective behavior on the selector path is byte-equivalent.

6. **Re-run static suite** — DONE. Ran `unset CLAUDECODE && make test-static` from worktree root.

   Final line verbatim:
   ```
   426 passed, 22 deselected, 10 subtests passed in 19.61s
   ```
   Zero failures. Matches both prior runs (426/426). AC #2 (≥ 422) satisfied.

7. **AC-4 (live CI dispatch verification) status** — DEFERRED-TO-MERGE-HOOK. The previous PR push + CI dispatch (PR #116, runs 24547231090 + 24547243582) was made under the OLD narrow scope. The scope-expansion commits (`a7fdf48a`) need to be pushed before CI re-runs can verify the make-target path. Push happens at the merge hook, not validation. Not pushing the branch; not dispatching CI here.

8. **Stage report appended** — DONE (this section).

9. **Commit on worktree branch** — pending immediately after this write; not pushed.

Recommendation: PASSED — both paths now correctly pinned, static suite N/N green, override mechanism verified, AC-4 deferred to merge hook re-push.
