# PR Merge

Manages the PR lifecycle for workflow entities processed in worktree stages. Pushes branches, creates PRs, detects merged PRs, and advances entities accordingly.

## Hook: startup

Scan all entity files (in the workflow directory only, not `_archive/`) for entities with a non-empty `pr` field and a non-terminal status. For each, extract the PR number (strip any `#`, `owner/repo#` prefix) and check: `gh pr view {number} --json state --jq '.state'`.

If `MERGED`, advance the entity to its terminal stage: set `status` to the terminal stage, `completed` to ISO 8601 now, `verdict: PASSED`, clear `worktree`, archive the file, and clean up any worktree/branch. Report each auto-advanced entity to the captain.

If `CLOSED` (closed without merge), report to the captain: "{entity title} has PR {pr number} which was closed without merging. How to proceed? Options: reopen the PR, create a new PR from the same branch, or clear `pr` and fall back to local merge." Wait for the captain's direction before taking action.

If `OPEN`, no action needed — the PR is still in review.

If `gh` is not available, warn the captain and skip PR state checks.

## Hook: idle

Check PR-pending entities using the same logic as the startup hook: scan entity files for non-empty `pr` and non-terminal status, run `gh pr view` for each, and advance merged PRs. This provides a periodic re-check in case the event loop's built-in PR scan missed a state change (defense in depth). Report any advanced entities to the captain.

## Hook: merge

**PR APPROVAL GUARDRAIL — Do NOT push or create a PR without explicit captain approval.** Before pushing, present a draft PR summary to the captain:

- **Title:** {entity title}
- **Branch:** {branch} -> main
- **Changes:** {N} file(s) changed across {N} commit(s)
- **Files:** {list of changed files}

Wait for the captain's explicit approval before pushing. Do NOT infer approval from silence, acknowledgment of the summary, or the gate approval that preceded this step — only an explicit "push it", "go ahead", "yes", or equivalent counts.

**On approval:** First, push main to ensure the remote is up to date with local state commits: `git push origin main`. Then rebase the worktree branch onto main: `git rebase main` (from the worktree directory). Then push the worktree branch: `git push origin {branch}`. If any step fails (no remote, auth error, rebase conflict), report to the captain and fall back to local merge.

Create a PR. Build the PR body: start with `Workflow entity: {entity title}`. If the entity has a non-empty `issue` field, append a blank line and `Closes {issue}` (using the value exactly as it appears in frontmatter, e.g., `#48` or `owner/repo#48`). Then run: `gh pr create --base main --head {branch} --title "{entity title}" --body "{constructed body}"`. If `gh` is not available, warn the captain and fall back to local merge.

Set the entity's `pr` field to the PR number (e.g., `#57`). Report the PR to the captain.

**On decline:** Do NOT automatically fall back to local merge. Ask the captain how to proceed — options include local merge or leaving the branch unmerged. Only act on the captain's explicit choice.

Do NOT archive yet. The entity stays at its current stage with `pr` set until the PR is merged. The FO handles advancement to the terminal stage and archival when it detects the merge (via the event loop PR check, idle hook, or startup hook).
