# Design and Build Spacedock - Plain Text Workflow for Agents

Spacedock is a Claude Code plugin that turns directories of markdown files into structured workflows operated by AI agents. This workflow tracks the design and implementation tasks for building Spacedock itself — from initial concepts through validated, shippable features.

## File Naming

Each task is a markdown file named `{slug}.md` — lowercase, hyphens, no spaces. Example: `pilot-worktree-isolation.md`.

## Schema

Every task file has YAML frontmatter. Fields are documented below; see **Task Template** for a copy-paste starter.

### Field Reference

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier, format determined by id-style in README frontmatter |
| `title` | string | Human-readable task name |
| `status` | enum | One of: backlog, ideation, implementation, validation, done |
| `source` | string | Where this task came from |
| `started` | ISO 8601 | When active work began |
| `completed` | ISO 8601 | When the task reached terminal status |
| `verdict` | enum | PASSED or REJECTED — set at final stage |
| `score` | number | Priority score, 0.0–1.0 (optional). Workflows can upgrade to a multi-dimension rubric in their README. |
| `worktree` | string | Worktree path while a dispatched agent is active, empty otherwise |
| `issue` | string | GitHub issue reference (e.g., `#42` or `owner/repo#42`). Optional cross-reference, set manually. |
| `pr` | string | GitHub PR reference (e.g., `#57` or `owner/repo#57`). Set when a PR is created for this entity's worktree branch. |
| `mod-block` | string | Pending mod-declared blocking action, format `{lifecycle_point}:{mod_name}`. Empty when no block is active. |

## Stages

### `backlog`

A task enters backlog when it is first proposed. It has a seed description but no design work has been done yet.

- **Inputs:** None — this is the initial state
- **Outputs:** A seed task file with title, source, and brief description
- **Good:** Clear enough to understand what the task is about
- **Bad:** N/A — backlog is a holding state, not an action

### `ideation`

A task moves to ideation when a pilot starts fleshing out the idea: clarify the problem, explore approaches, and produce a concrete description of what "done" looks like.

- **Inputs:** The seed description and any relevant context (existing code, user feedback, related tasks)
- **Outputs:** A fleshed-out task body with problem statement, proposed approach, acceptance criteria, and a test plan
  - Acceptance criteria must include how each criterion will be tested
  - Test plan: what tests verify the implementation, estimated cost/complexity, whether E2E tests are needed
  - For template changes: specific before/after wording, not just "change X"
- **Good:** Clearly scoped, actionable, addresses a real need, considers edge cases, test plan proportional to risk (static checks for simple wording, E2E for behavioral guarantees)
- **Bad:** Vague hand-waving, scope creep, solving problems that don't exist yet, no clear definition of done, acceptance criteria without a test plan
- **Staff review:** When the FO assesses ideation as complex (touches scaffolding, requires E2E tests, or score >= 0.8), it spawns a fresh independent reviewer subagent before presenting at the ideation gate. The reviewer checks design soundness, test plan sufficiency, and gaps. The captain sees both the ideation and the reviewer's assessment.

### `implementation`

A task moves to implementation once its design is approved. The work here is to produce the deliverable: write code, run experiments, generate analysis, or make whatever changes the task describes. Implementation is complete when the deliverable exists and is ready for independent verification.

- **Inputs:** The fleshed-out task body from ideation with approach and acceptance criteria
- **Outputs:** The deliverable committed to the repo (code, experiment results, analysis, test suites — whatever the task specifies), with a summary of what was produced and where
- **Good:** Minimal changes that satisfy acceptance criteria, clean code, tests where appropriate, deliverable is self-contained and verifiable
- **Bad:** Over-engineering, unrelated refactoring, skipping tests, ignoring edge cases identified in ideation, leaving the deliverable incomplete for validation to finish

### `validation`

A task moves to validation after implementation is complete. The work here is to verify the deliverable meets the acceptance criteria defined in ideation. The validator checks what was produced — it does not produce the deliverable itself.

- **Inputs:** The implementation summary and the acceptance criteria from the task body
- **Outputs:**
  - Run applicable tests from the Testing Resources section and report results
    - Use `tests/README.md` to choose the right harness and entrypoint before running tests
    - Prefer the stable repo-level entrypoints when they fit the task: `make test-static` for the offline suite, `make test-live-claude` / `make test-live-codex` for tier-aware live runs, and `make test-e2e TEST=... RUNTIME=...` for single-file runtime-specific E2E checks
  - Verify each acceptance criterion with evidence
  - A PASSED/REJECTED recommendation
- **Good:** Thorough testing against acceptance criteria, clear evidence of pass/fail, honest assessment
- **Bad:** Rubber-stamping without actually testing, ignoring failing edge cases, validating against wrong criteria
- **Spot-check principle:** Before committing to an expensive multi-run experiment or long test suite, do a cheap single-run spot-check (ideally on a smaller/cheaper model) to verify the infrastructure works end-to-end. Fix broken plumbing before burning budget on real runs.

### `done`

A task reaches done when validation is complete and CL approves the result. The task is closed with a verdict of PASSED or REJECTED.

- **Inputs:** The validation report with PASSED/REJECTED recommendation
- **Outputs:** Final verdict set in frontmatter, completed timestamp recorded
- **Good:** Clear resolution, lessons learned captured if relevant
- **Bad:** Closing without reading the validation report, overriding a REJECTED recommendation without reason

## Testing Resources

Validation pilots should use these when verifying implementation work:

| Resource | Path | Covers |
|----------|------|--------|
| Commission test harness | `scripts/test-harness.md` | Batch-mode commission invocation, generated file validation, guardrail checks |
| Rejection flow E2E test | `tests/test_rejection_flow.py` | Validation rejection detection, validator-to-implementer relay dispatch |
| Scaffolding guardrail E2E test | `tests/test_scaffolding_guardrail.py` | Scaffolding change guardrail, issue filing guardrail |
| Merge hook guardrail E2E test | `tests/test_merge_hook_guardrail.py` | Merge hook fires before local merge, no-mods fallback |
| Repo edit guardrail E2E test | `tests/test_repo_edit_guardrail.py` | FO write scope guardrail, code/test/mod edit rejection |
| Test authoring and execution guide | `tests/README.md` | Test infrastructure, stable entrypoints, CLI conventions, fixtures, and harness selection |

The test harness documents how to run `claude -p` with `--plugin-dir` for non-interactive commission testing, plus structural and guardrail assertions against the generated output. Use it for any task that changes `skills/commission/SKILL.md` or the first-officer template.

Validators should treat `tests/README.md` as the authoritative guide for selecting the right test surface and command shape. Not every validation run should use the same entrypoint: some tasks need the offline repo suite, some need runtime-specific E2E coverage, and some need both.

The stable repo-level offline suite is:

```bash
make test-static
```

Live E2E checks go through the pytest two-tier wrappers:

```bash
make test-live-claude                                # serial tier, then parallel tier
make test-live-codex
make test-live-claude-opus                           # same shape, --model opus --effort low
make test-e2e TEST=tests/test_gate_guardrail.py RUNTIME=codex   # single-file override
```

- `test-live-{claude,codex}` run the serial tier (`-m "... and serial" -x`) first, then the parallel tier (`-m "... and not serial" -n $LIVE_{CLAUDE,CODEX}_WORKERS`) regardless of the serial tier outcome. Overall result is the logical AND of both exit codes.
- `test-e2e` replaces the old `test-e2e-commission` target: pass `TEST=tests/test_commission.py` for the same effect.
- Use direct `uv run pytest …` invocations only when the test guide calls for a more specific command than the stable wrappers provide.

### Running E2E tests

Tests run under pytest. When running from inside a Claude Code session, unset `CLAUDECODE` first (Claude refuses to launch as a subprocess when this variable is set):

    unset CLAUDECODE && uv run pytest tests/test_output_format.py --runtime claude -v

This applies to every test invocation, including those behind the `make test-static` / `make test-live-*` / `make test-e2e` wrappers.
