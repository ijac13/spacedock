# Codex First Officer Runtime

This file defines how the shared first-officer core executes on Codex.

## Entry Surface

The user-invocable entrypoint is `spacedock:first-officer`.
That skill should immediately bootstrap `../../agents/first-officer.md`.
The packaged first-officer agent asset, not the skill wrapper, should carry the operational contract.

## Workflow Target

- If the user gives an explicit workflow path, use it.
- If not, discover candidate workflows from the current repository.
- If multiple candidates exist, ask the user which workflow to manage.
- If the session is non-interactive (e.g., `codex exec`) and the prompt names a specific entity to process, apply the shared single-entity mode rules.

When the workflow path is explicit, do not spend time rediscovering alternatives. Move directly to:
- README
- `status` output
- the in-scope entity file

When creating a new entity, use `status --next-id` to fetch only the next sequential ID. Reserve `status --boot` for startup diagnostics and broader workflow inventory.

## Packaged Worker Resolution

- Treat names like `spacedock:ensign` as logical ids, not native Codex agent types.
- For Spacedock-packaged ids, the worker resolves its role definition through skill preloading:
  `~/.agents/skills/{namespace}/{name}/SKILL.md`
- Preserve the logical id exactly as `dispatch_agent_id: spacedock:ensign` when that packaged worker is selected.
- Derive the safe naming key as `worker_key: spacedock-ensign`.
- Use the concrete asset stem `role_asset_name: ensign` for the packaged skill; do not reuse the logical id there.
- Use `worker_key` for worktree paths as `.worktrees/{worker_key}-{slug}` and branch names as `{worker_key}/{slug}`.
- Never collapse a packaged logical id to bare `ensign` for worktree, branch, or session naming.

Split worker identity into:
- `dispatch_agent_id`
- `worker_key`

For operator-facing status updates and routed follow-up messages, also keep a human-readable worker label. Use a stable `{entity_id}-{stage_key}/{display_name}` convention such as `130-impl/Herschel` or `130-validation/Herschel`. Report that label alongside the logical id or thread handle; do not rely on opaque agent ids or incidental nicknames alone.

## Dispatch Adapter

Codex does not natively spawn packaged names like `spacedock:ensign`.

Codex effectively operates in direct-handle dispatch:
- the first officer owns orchestration directly
- fresh workers are created through `spawn_agent`
- completed workers can still be reused later if their handle remains addressable and the shared reuse conditions still pass
- if the run is bounded to a single entity or first meaningful outcome, terminate once that condition is satisfied

Speed and boundedness matter on the Codex path. Do not spend time on exploratory reads that are not needed for the next dispatch or stop condition.

Avoid these wasteful actions unless a real blocker forces them:
- rereading your own skill files after activation
- opening the packaged worker skill asset just to inspect it
- reading the source code of `{workflow_dir}/status` instead of running it
- scanning unrelated entities when the run is scoped to one entity
- reading large files past the specific stage/entity sections you need

For each dispatch:
1. Resolve the logical id into a safe `worker_key`.
2. Derive and report the human-readable worker label for the stage assignment.
3. Create the worktree if required.
4. Spawn a generic worker with `spawn_agent(..., fork_context=false)`.
5. In the worker prompt:
   - first instruct the worker to resolve its role definition from the logical id and read it before doing anything else
   - then pass the assignment fields

When the worker reaches a completed state, keep its returned handle and worker label as long as later routing may still need that thread.

Reuse flow:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Completed worker] --> B{Addressable and reuse conditions pass?}
    B -- No --> C[Fresh dispatch or explicit shutdown]
    B -- Yes --> D[send_input with full next-stage work]
    D --> E[Mark worker active again]
    E --> F{Reused result on this entity's critical path?}
    F -- No --> G[Keep alive or background route]
    F -- Yes --> H[wait_agent on same handle]
    H --> I[Use only post-wait completion as evidence]
    I --> J{More routing expected?}
    J -- Yes --> K[Keep handle alive]
    J -- No --> L[Explicit shutdown]
```

The immediate `send_input` tool result is not completion evidence for the reused cycle; it can still echo the worker's prior completed state.

For routed advancement or `feedback-to` follow-up:
- if the completed worker is still addressable and the shared reuse conditions pass, deliver the next assignment through `send_input` on that existing worker handle
- use `send_input` for same-thread advancement reuse and for feedback routed back to a completed implementation worker
- do not spawn a replacement worker when reuse is valid
- routed follow-up must carry the concrete next-stage work to perform in that thread, not an acknowledgment-only ping
- after `send_input`, treat that reused worker as active again rather than merely still addressable
- if the reused worker's result is on that entity's current critical path, call `wait_agent` on that same worker handle before advancing that entity
- do not treat an entity with a reused in-flight worker as idle just because the handle was previously completed
- this is entity-scoped bookkeeping, not a whole-FO stop-the-world rule; unrelated ready entities may still be dispatched or advanced
- do not treat critical-path `send_input` as fire-and-forget background work
- do not treat the immediate `send_input` tool result as proof that the reused cycle is complete; it can still reflect the worker's prior completed state until `wait_agent` observes the new completion
- after critical-path reuse, the next completion evidence must come from `wait_agent` on that same handle, not from the stale completion echoed by `send_input`
- for `feedback-to` reuse, that next completion evidence should describe the actual follow-up fix or report update, including any new commit, not just receipt of the rejection

Explicit shutdown is required when a worker is no longer needed:
- after a fresh replacement takes over and the old worker will not receive later routing
- after a routed follow-up is delivered and another kept-alive worker is no longer needed
- when reuse is blocked and the old completed worker will not be reused
- when the entity reaches a terminal state
- after the reused cycle completes and no later advancement, feedback, or gate handling is expected for that worker

On the Codex path, "no longer needed" means no further advancement, feedback, or gate-related routing is expected for that worker. Do not leave shutdown implicit; call the runtime shutdown path explicitly before stopping.

For bounded terminal-completion runs, continue through the shared merge-and-cleanup flow in this runtime.

Do not rely on inherited thread context. The worker prompt must be fully self-contained so the worker can start with `fork_context=false`.
Never omit `fork_context=false` on worker dispatches in Codex.

Use this exact pattern:

```text
spawn_agent(
  agent_type="worker",
  fork_context=false,
  message="<fully self-contained worker assignment>"
)
wait_agent(...)
```

Always preserve the logical packaged id in summaries and use only `worker_key` in branch/worktree/session names.
When reusing a completed worker, the equivalent pattern is `send_input(<existing_handle>, message="<next assignment>")` followed by `wait_agent(...)` on that same handle when the reused result is part of that entity's current critical path, then explicit shutdown once the reused cycle is complete and the worker is no longer needed. This wait blocks advancement of that entity, not unrelated ready entities.

## Codex Worker Assignment Fields

Pass these fields to a worker:
- `dispatch_agent_id`
- `worker_key`
- `role_asset_kind`
- `role_asset_name`
- `workflow_dir`
- `entity_path`
- `stage_name`
- `stage_definition_text`
- `worktree_path` when present
- checklist items

If a `worktree_path` is present, `entity_path` should point to the entity file inside that worktree, not the main-branch copy.

## Codex Merge And Cleanup

- Merge hooks live under `{workflow_dir}/_mods/*.md`.
- For a deterministic Codex terminal path, follow the shared merge-and-cleanup flow in this runtime.
- The runtime should run merge hooks before local merge, stop on `pr_pending`, and otherwise perform local merge, archive, terminal commit, and worktree cleanup.

## Codex Completion Shape

- Workers report completion by returning a concise final response.
- The first officer treats the entity file and stage report as the source of truth.
- The first officer waits for the worker result before continuing.
- In bounded single-entity runs, if the worker completion message already contains the requested verdict, evidence, or terminal outcome, use that message as sufficient evidence for the final response and stop immediately.
- Only reread the entity file or rerun `status` after `wait_agent(...)` when the worker message is missing a detail required by the stated stop condition.

## Bounded Prototype Rule

For the current Codex spike:
- stop after the first meaningful outcome only when the requested bounded outcome does not require routed reuse or feedback bounce
- if the workflow is waiting at a gate, report the gate review and stop
- if a worker returns a verdict or concrete evidence, summarize it and stop
- if a feedback stage rejects, mention the follow-up target even if the full bounce loop is not completed in the same run
- when the run is explicitly in single-entity mode, prefer the shared single-entity termination/output rules over generic status summaries
- if the requested bounded outcome includes a routed reuse or feedback bounce, the generic early-stop bullets above do not apply until `wait_agent` returns the reused worker's actual follow-up completion evidence

For a bounded run, once the stop condition is satisfied:
- send one concise final response
- do not perform extra file reads
- do not start another dispatch cycle
- do not wait for additional agents unless their completion is required by the stated stop condition
