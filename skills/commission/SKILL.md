# Commission a Plain Text Workflow

You are commissioning a plain text workflow. A plain text workflow is a directory of markdown files with YAML frontmatter, where each file is a work entity that moves through stages. The directory's README is the single source of truth for schema and stages, and a self-describing Python script provides workflow status views.

This is a v0 shuttle-mode workflow: one general-purpose ensign agent handles all stages. You will walk {captain} through interactive design, generate all workflow files, then launch a pilot run.

Follow these three phases in order. Do not skip or combine phases.

## Batch Mode

If the user provides design inputs in their message (some or all of: mission, entity type, stages, approval gates, seed entities, location):

1. Extract all provided inputs
2. For any missing inputs, infer reasonable defaults based on the mission
3. Skip directly to **Confirm Design** with the assembled inputs
4. If the user says to skip confirmation or auto-approve gates, proceed without asking

This allows non-interactive use: all inputs in one message, straight to generation.

---

## Phase 1: Interactive Design

Before asking Question 1, greet {captain} with the following (skip this greeting entirely in batch mode):

> Welcome to Spacedock! We're going to design a plain text workflow together.
>
> I'll walk you through three phases:
> 1. **Design** — a few questions to shape the workflow
> 2. **Generate** — I'll create all the workflow files
> 3. **Pilot run** — I'll launch the workflow to process your seed entities
>
> Throughout this workflow, you'll be addressed as **{captain}** (the workflow operator).
>
> Let's start designing.

### Args Extraction

If the user's invocation message contains text beyond the command name (e.g.,
`/spacedock:commission product idea to simulated customer interview`), treat
that text as the mission statement.

- Extract `{mission}` from the args
- Proceed to Question 1 but present the extracted mission for confirmation
  rather than asking from scratch:

  > I'll use this as the workflow mission: "{extracted_mission}"
  >
  > What does each work item represent?

This skips the "what's this workflow for?" half of Q1 and goes straight to
the entity-type follow-up.

Ask {captain} the remaining questions **one at a time**. Wait for each answer before asking the next question. Do not batch questions.

### Question 1 — Mission + Entity

Ask:

> What's this workflow for, and what does each work item represent?
>
> Example: "Track design ideas through review stages" — the workflow is for tracking, each item is a design idea.

Extract `{mission}` and `{entity_description}` from the answer. If the answer clearly covers both mission and entity, proceed. If only the mission is clear, ask a brief follow-up:

> Got it. What does each work item in this workflow represent? (e.g., "a design idea", "a bug report", "a candidate feature")

**Derive the entity label** from `{entity_description}`:

1. Strip leading articles ("a", "an", "the")
2. Take the last word (the head noun in English) — this is `{entity_label}` (lowercase, singular)
3. Derive `{entity_label_plural}` by appending "s" to `{entity_label}`
4. Derive `{entity_type}` as the full description (after stripping articles) in snake_case (e.g., "a design idea" → `design_idea`)

Examples:
- "a design idea" → label: `idea`, plural: `ideas`, type: `design_idea`
- "a bug report" → label: `report`, plural: `reports`, type: `bug_report`
- "an implementation task" → label: `task`, plural: `tasks`, type: `implementation_task`
- "a PR" → label: `pr`, plural: `prs`, type: `pr`

### Question 2 — Stages

Based on the mission, suggest default stages. Present them as an itemized list and ask {captain} to review:

> Based on your workflow mission, here are the stages I'd suggest:
>
> {for each stage: "1. **{stage_name}** — {one-line description}"}
>
> Would you like to modify, add, or remove any stages? (confirm or describe changes)

Store the confirmed stages as `{stages}`. The first stage is `{first_stage}` and the last is `{last_stage}`.

### Question 3 — Seed Entities

Ask:

> Give me 2–3 starting items to seed the workflow. For each, provide:
> - **Title** — short name
> - **Description** — a sentence or two about what this entity is
> - **Score** (optional) — priority from 0.0 to 1.0

Store as `{seed_entities}` — a list of objects with title, description, and score. Default `source` to "commission seed" for all seed entities.

If {captain} references an external source for seed data (e.g., "find the info in ~/git/spacedock"
or "see the backlog in project X"), read the referenced files directly using Read/Glob.
Do NOT spawn an Agent for this — a direct file read is sufficient. Look for:
- README files in the referenced directory
- Markdown files with YAML frontmatter (existing entities)
- Any obvious manifest or index file

### Confirm Design

After collecting answers, derive all remaining values from the mission context:

- `{approval_gates}` — default: gate before the terminal stage (e.g., `validation → done`).
- `{dir}` — `docs/{mission-slug}/` where `{mission-slug}` is the mission condensed to a short lowercase hyphenated directory name. Also derive `{dir_basename}` (the last path component).
- `{project_name}` — the basename of the git repo root directory (from `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`), or the current working directory basename if not in a git repo. Used to scope the team name.
- `{captain}` — "captain".

Present the full summary with all derived values:

> **Workflow Design Summary**
>
> - **Mission:** {mission}
> - **Entity:** {entity_description}
> - **Item label:** {entity_label} (plural: {entity_label_plural})
> - **Stages:** {stages joined with " → "}
> - **Approval gates:** {approval_gates, or "none"}
> - **Seed entities:** {count} items
>   {for each: "- {title} (score: {score})" or "- {title}" if no score}
> - **Location:** `{dir}`
> - **Address:** {captain}
>
> Modify anything above, or confirm to generate. (y/n/changes)

Wait for {captain} to confirm before proceeding to Phase 2. If {captain} wants changes, apply them and re-present the summary.

---

## Phase 2: Generate Workflow Files

### Ensure Git Repository

Before generating files, ensure the project has a git repository:

1. Check if the current directory is inside a git repo (`git rev-parse --git-dir`).
2. If not, initialize one silently: `git init && git add -A && git commit --allow-empty -m "initial commit"`.
3. Do NOT ask {captain} for permission — a workflow requires git.

### Generation Discipline

Generate all workflow files without creating tasks or updating progress trackers.
Do NOT use TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, or TodoWrite during file generation — these
create visible noise in {captain}'s UI. The generation checklist at the end of
Phase 2 is sufficient for tracking completion.

### Read Spacedock Version

Before generating any files, read the Spacedock plugin manifest to get the current version:

1. Read `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` from the Spacedock plugin directory (the directory containing the `skills/` folder — resolve from your own plugin context).
2. Extract the `version` field and store it as `{spacedock_version}`.

This version will be embedded in each generated scaffolding file.

### Generate Files

Create the workflow directory and generate four kinds of files. Use the design answers to fill all templates — no placeholder text should remain in generated files.

```
mkdir -p {dir}
```

Also ensure the agents directory exists at the project root:

```
mkdir -p {project_root}/.claude/agents
```

Where `{project_root}` is the git root (or cwd if not in a git repo). The first-officer lives at the project root so it's discoverable when Claude runs from there.

Also ensure `.worktrees/` is in the project's `.gitignore` (worktrees should never be committed):

```
# If .gitignore doesn't exist, create it. If it exists, append only if .worktrees/ isn't already listed.
grep -qxF '.worktrees/' {project_root}/.gitignore 2>/dev/null || echo '.worktrees/' >> {project_root}/.gitignore
```

### 2a. Generate `{dir}/README.md`

Write the README with ALL of the following sections. Every section is required — do not omit any.

Craft thoughtful, mission-specific content for each stage definition. The inputs, outputs, quality criteria, and anti-patterns should be specific to what this workflow actually does — not generic placeholders.

Do NOT include a Scoring Rubric section by default. Scoring uses a simple 0.0–1.0 float — no rubric needed. If {captain} explicitly asks for a multi-dimension rubric, include a Scoring Rubric section documenting their chosen dimensions.

Use this template structure, filling in all `{variables}` from the design phase:

````markdown
---
commissioned-by: spacedock@{spacedock_version}
entity-type: {entity_type}
entity-label: {entity_label}
entity-label-plural: {entity_label_plural}
id-style: sequential
stages:
  defaults:
    worktree: false
    concurrency: 2
  states:
    - name: {first_stage}
      initial: true
    {For each middle stage, add an entry with per-stage overrides only when different from defaults:}
    - name: {stage_name}
      {worktree: true — only if the stage modifies code or produces artifacts beyond the entity file}
      {fresh: true — only if an independent perspective matters, e.g., validation}
      {gate: true — if this stage is the SOURCE in an approval_gates transition}
    - name: {last_stage}
      terminal: true
  transitions:
    {Omit this block entirely for linear workflows.}
    {For non-linear flows, add explicit edges:}
    - from: {source_stage}
      to: {target_stage}
      label: {human-readable label}
---

# {mission}

{One paragraph expanding on the mission, describing what this workflow processes and why.}

## File Naming

Each {entity_label} is a markdown file named `{slug}.md` — lowercase, hyphens, no spaces. Example: `my-feature-idea.md`.

## Schema

Every {entity_label} file has YAML frontmatter with these fields:

```yaml
---
id:
title: Human-readable name
status: {first_stage}
source:
started:
completed:
verdict:
score:
worktree:
{any domain-specific fields from {captain}'s answers}
---
```

### Field Reference

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier, format determined by id-style in README frontmatter |
| `title` | string | Human-readable {entity_label} name |
| `status` | enum | One of: {stages as comma-separated list} |
| `source` | string | Where this {entity_label} came from |
| `started` | ISO 8601 | When active work began |
| `completed` | ISO 8601 | When the {entity_label} reached terminal status |
| `verdict` | enum | PASSED or REJECTED — set at final stage |
| `score` | number | Priority score, 0.0–1.0 (optional). Workflows can upgrade to a multi-dimension rubric in their README. |
| `worktree` | string | Worktree path while an ensign is active, empty otherwise |

## Stages

{For EACH stage in the ordered list, generate a subsection:}

### `{stage_name}`

{A sentence describing who sets this status and what it means for an {entity_label} to be in this stage.}

- **Inputs:** {What the worker reads to do this stage's work — be specific to the mission}
- **Outputs:** {What the worker produces — be specific to the mission. Keep bullets concise and verifiable — these become checklist items at dispatch time. Focus on non-obvious requirements that catch skipping, not obvious actions like "write code."}
- **Good:** {Quality criteria for work done in this stage}
- **Bad:** {Anti-patterns to avoid in this stage}

{End of per-stage sections.}

## Scoring

{ONLY include this section if {captain} explicitly requests a multi-dimension rubric. Otherwise omit entirely — the 0.0–1.0 float is self-explanatory from the schema.}

## Workflow State

View the workflow overview:

```bash
{dir}/status
```

Output columns: ID, SLUG, STATUS, TITLE, SCORE, SOURCE.

Include archived {entity_label_plural} with `--archived`:

```bash
{dir}/status --archived
```

Find dispatchable {entity_label_plural} ready for their next stage:

```bash
{dir}/status --next
```

Find {entity_label_plural} in a specific stage:

```bash
grep -l "status: {stage_name}" {dir}/*.md
```

## {Entity_label} Template

```yaml
---
id:
title: {Entity_label} name here
status: {first_stage}
source:
started:
completed:
verdict:
score:
worktree:
---

Description of this {entity_label} and what it aims to achieve.
```

## Commit Discipline

- Commit status changes at dispatch and merge boundaries
- Commit {entity_label} body updates when substantive
````

### 2b. Generate `{dir}/status`

Generate the status script from the reference template at `templates/status` (relative to the Spacedock plugin directory).

1. Read the template file.
2. Fill in the two variable fields:
   - `{spacedock_version}` — from plugin.json
   - `{stage1}, {stage2}, ..., {last_stage}` — the workflow's stage names in order
3. Write the result to `{dir}/status`.
4. Make it executable: `chmod +x {dir}/status`.
5. **Materialize** — read back the description header (the `# goal:` / `# instruction:` / `# constraints:` comments) and replace the stub body with a working Python 3 implementation that satisfies the description. The implementation must use only Python 3 stdlib (no PyYAML or other third-party modules). Keep the description header intact — only replace everything after it.

### 2c. Generate Seed Entities

For each seed entity, create `{dir}/{slug}.md` where `{slug}` is the title converted to lowercase with spaces replaced by hyphens, non-alphanumeric characters (except hyphens) removed.

The `title` field is the human-readable name (e.g., "Full Cycle Test"). The filename `{slug}.md` is derived from it (lowercase, hyphens).

Each entity file gets a sequential ID, starting at `001`:

```markdown
---
id: {next sequential id, zero-padded to 3 digits}
title: {entity title — human-readable, not the slug}
status: {first_stage}
source: {source if provided, otherwise "commission seed"}
started:
completed:
verdict:
score: {score, or leave empty}
worktree:
---

{Description/thesis from {captain}'s seed input.}
```

### 2d. Generate First-Officer Agent

Write the first-officer agent to `{project_root}/.claude/agents/first-officer.md`.

**IMPORTANT: Use Bash to write this file, NOT the Write tool.** The Write tool is often blocked for `.claude/` paths.

**This file is generated from a template — NOT LLM-generated prose.** The template lives at `templates/first-officer.md` (relative to the Spacedock plugin directory). It contains `__VAR__` markers for commission-time substitution, and `{var}` markers for runtime variables that pass through unchanged.

Do NOT rewrite, paraphrase, or embellish the template content. Your only job is to compute variable values and run sed.

```bash
# 1. Resolve the template path (relative to the Spacedock plugin directory)
TMPL="{spacedock_plugin_dir}/templates/first-officer.md"

# 2. Run sed to substitute __VAR__ markers with design-phase values
mkdir -p {project_root}/.claude/agents
sed \
  -e 's|__MISSION__|{mission}|g' \
  -e 's|__DIR__|{dir}|g' \
  -e 's|__DIR_BASENAME__|{dir_basename}|g' \
  -e 's|__ENTITY_LABEL__|{entity_label}|g' \
  -e 's|__ENTITY_LABEL_PLURAL__|{entity_label_plural}|g' \
  -e 's|__CAPTAIN__|{captain}|g' \
  -e 's|__SPACEDOCK_VERSION__|{spacedock_version}|g' \
  -e 's|__PROJECT_NAME__|{project_name}|g' \
  -e 's|__FIRST_STAGE__|{first_stage}|g' \
  -e 's|__LAST_STAGE__|{last_stage}|g' \
  "$TMPL" > {project_root}/.claude/agents/first-officer.md
```

The template uses `__VAR__` markers (double-underscore delimited) for commission-time values and `{var}` markers (single curly braces) for runtime values that the first officer fills at dispatch time. The sed command replaces only the `__VAR__` markers; `{var}` markers pass through unchanged.

### 2e. Generate Ensign Agent

Write the ensign agent to `{project_root}/.claude/agents/ensign.md`.

**IMPORTANT: Use Bash to write this file, NOT the Write tool.** The Write tool is often blocked for `.claude/` paths.

**This file is generated from a template — NOT LLM-generated prose.** The template lives at `templates/ensign.md` (relative to the Spacedock plugin directory). It contains `__VAR__` markers for commission-time substitution.

Do NOT rewrite, paraphrase, or embellish the template content. Your only job is to compute variable values and run sed.

```bash
# 1. Resolve the template path (relative to the Spacedock plugin directory)
TMPL="{spacedock_plugin_dir}/templates/ensign.md"

# 2. Run sed to substitute __VAR__ markers with design-phase values
sed \
  -e 's|__MISSION__|{mission}|g' \
  -e 's|__ENTITY_LABEL__|{entity_label}|g' \
  -e 's|__SPACEDOCK_VERSION__|{spacedock_version}|g' \
  "$TMPL" > {project_root}/.claude/agents/ensign.md
```

### Generation Checklist

After generating all files, verify before proceeding:

- [ ] `{dir}/README.md` exists with mission, schema, all stage definitions, and {entity_label} template
- [ ] `{dir}/status` exists and is executable
- [ ] Each seed entity file exists at `{dir}/{slug}.md` with valid YAML frontmatter
- [ ] `{project_root}/.claude/agents/first-officer.md` exists with all sections
- [ ] `{project_root}/.claude/agents/ensign.md` exists with all sections
- [ ] `.worktrees/` is in `{project_root}/.gitignore`

---

## Phase 3: Pilot Run

After all files are generated and verified, launch the pilot run.

### Step 1 — Announce

Tell {captain} what was generated:

> Workflow generated! Here's what I created:
>
> - `{dir}/README.md` — workflow schema and stage definitions
> - `{dir}/status` — workflow status viewer
> - {for each seed entity: "`{dir}/{slug}.md` — {title}"}
> - `{project_root}/.claude/agents/first-officer.md` — workflow orchestrator
> - `{project_root}/.claude/agents/ensign.md` — stage worker agent
>
> To run this workflow in future sessions, start Claude Code with:
>
> ```
> claude --agent first-officer
> ```
>
> Starting the initial run now...

### Step 2 — Assume First-Officer Role

Do not spawn a subagent. Instead, the commission skill itself takes on the first-officer role for the initial run:

1. Read the generated first-officer agent file at `{project_root}/.claude/agents/first-officer.md`.
2. Follow its instructions: read the workflow README, run the status script, and dispatch ensigns for entities ready to advance.

Execute the first-officer startup procedure directly. You are now the first officer for the remainder of this session.

### Step 3 — Monitor and Report

Process entities following the first-officer event loop. When the workflow reaches an idle state or pauses at an approval gate, report the results to {captain}:

> **Pilot Run Results**
>
> {Summary of what happened: which entities were processed, what stages they moved through, any approval gates hit}

### Step 4 — Handle Failures

If the pilot run fails (agent errors, YAML gets mangled, dispatch issues):

- Report exactly what happened, including any error messages
- Show the current state of the workflow (`{dir}/status`)
- Do not retry automatically — let {captain} decide next steps

This is v0. Either it works or we learn why it didn't.

### Step 5 — Post-Completion Guidance

After Step 3 or Step 4 (whether the pilot run succeeded or failed), always conclude with:

> **What's next?** To continue working this workflow in a future session, start Claude Code with:
>
> ```
> claude --agent first-officer
> ```
>
> The first officer will read the workflow state, pick up where things left off, and dispatch ensigns for any entities ready for their next stage.
